/**
 * You just bought yourself the latest game from the Majong™ studio (recently acquired by Macrosoft™): MineClimb™.
 * In this 3D game, the map is made up of size 1 dimensional cube blocks, aligned on a grid, forming vertical columns of cubes.
 * There are no holes in the columns, so the state of the map can be represented as a matrix M of size n⋅m
 * where the entry Mi,j is the height of the cube column located at i,j (0≤i<n, 0≤j<m).
 * You can't delete or add cubes, but you do have climbing gear that allows you to move from one column to another
 * (in the usual four directions (north, south, east, west), but not diagonally). The world of MineClimb™ is round:
 * the position north of (0,j) is (n-1,j), the position west of (i,0) is (i,m-1) , and vice versa.
 * <p>
 * The time taken to climb up or down a column depends on the difference in height between the current column and the next one.
 * Precisely, the time taken to go from column (i,j) to column (k,l) is |M_{i,j}-M_{k,l}|
 * <p>
 * Given the map of the mine, an initial position and an end position,
 * what is the minimum time needed to reach the end position from the initial position?
