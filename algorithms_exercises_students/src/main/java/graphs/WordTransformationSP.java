/**
 * You are asked to implement the WordTransformationSP class which allows to find the shortest path
 * from a string A to another string B (with the certainty that there is a path from A to B).
 * To do this, we define a rotation(x, y) operation that reverses the order of the letters between the x and y positions (not included).
 * For example, with A=``HAMBURGER``, if we do rotation(A, 4, 8), we get HAMBEGRUR. So you can see that the URGE sub-string
 * has been inverted to EGRU and the rest of the string has remained unchanged: HAMB + ECRU + R = HAMBEGRUR.
 * Let's say that a rotation(x, y) has a cost of y-x. For example going from HAMBURGER to HAMBEGRUR costs 8-4 = 4.
 * The question is what is the minimum cost to reach a string B from A?
 * So you need to implement a public static int minimalCost(String A, String B)
 * function that returns the minimum cost to reach String B from A using the rotation operation.
