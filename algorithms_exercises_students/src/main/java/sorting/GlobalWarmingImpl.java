/**
 * Author Pierre Schaus
 *
 * Assume the following 5x5 matrix that represent a grid surface:
 * int [][] tab = new int[][] {{1,3,3,1,3},
 *                             {4,2,2,4,5},
 *                             {4,4,1,4,2},
 *                             {1,4,2,3,6},
 *                             {1,1,1,6,3}};
 *
 * Each entry in the matrix represents an altitude point at the corresponding grid coordinate.
 * The goal is to implement a GlobalWarmingImpl class that extends the GlobalWarming abstract class described below.
 *
 * Given a global water level, all positions in the matrix with a value <= the water level are flooded and therefore unsafe.
 * So, assuming the water level is 3, all safe points are highlighted between parenthesis:
 *
 *   1 , 3 , 3 , 1 , 3
 *  (4), 2 , 2 ,(4),(5)
 *  (4),(4), 1 ,(4), 2
 *   1 ,(4), 2 , 3 ,(6)
 *   1 , 1 , 1 ,(6), 3}
 *
 * The method you need to implement is nbSafePoints
 * - calculating the number of safe points for a given water level
 *
 * Complete the code below. Pay attention to the expected time complexity of each method.
 * To meet this time complexity, you need to do some pre-computation in the constructor.
 * Feel free to create internal classes in GlobalWarmingImpl to make your implementation easier.
 * Feel free to use any method or data structure available in the Java language and API.
