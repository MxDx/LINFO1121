/**
 * This class represent a MinMaxHeap (generic over a Key type) implement as an array-based array.
 * Such data structure is useful to store elements and retrieve their minimum/maximum in constant time.
 * In order to do so, the invariants that are usually used in minimum or maximum heap are adapted.
 * For example, the `BinaryHeap` class (that you can find in another exercise) implements a minimum heap
 * by keeping the following invariant true: "For any node in the tree, every of its descendant has a value
 * greater or equal than it".
 * A similar invariant can be expressed for maximum heap.
 *
 * In a MinMaxHeap, the tree is decomposed into layers based on the depth of the node:
 *  - Every node in a depth which is even (0, 2, 4, ...) is a *min layer*
 *  - Every node in a depth which is odd (1, 3, 5, ...) is a *max layer*
 *
 * and the following invariants hold:
 *  - For every node in a min layer, every of its descendant has a value greater than it
 *  - For every node in a max layer, every of its descendant has a value lower than it
 *
 * In this exercise you need implement three methods:
 *  1) The min() method which return the minimum of the heap
 *  2) The max() method which return the maximum of the heap
 *  3) The swim() method which is used after a call to `insert` for ensuring the invariants
 *      of the MinMaxHeap are respected
 *
 * To help you for the swim function, a `getNodeDepth` function is provided which returns the depth of a node.
