/**
 * In this task, you must implement the `push` operation on a binary heap data structure.
 * As a reminder, a heap is a tree data structure such that the following invariant is respected
 *  
 *      For any node in the tree, the value associated with the node is higher (for a maxHeap) or lower
 *      (for a minHeap) than the value of its children.
 *
 * As a consequence, the minimum/maximum value is located at the root and can be retrieved in constant time.
 * In particular, this invariant must be respected after a push (or remove) operation.
 *
 * In this exercise the tree is represented with an array. The parent-child relation is implicitely represented
 * by the indices. A node at index i has its two children at index 2i and 2i+1.
 * For this is it assumed that the root is located at index 1 in the array.
